# Web Development Rules

A comprehensive guide for building consistent user interfaces, completing features end-to-end, and maintaining lean, readable codebases.

Adapted and unified from DealTech UI, Vibes-Plug, Ponytail, Impeccable, nyancodeid commit conventions, Humanize Pro, and zero-emoji policies.

## How to Use

Attach this file or include relevant sections in your project instructions (such as `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.windsurfrules`, or your AI assistant system prompt). Maintain any project-specific constraints already in place. This document acts as an operational standard and quality benchmark.

Applies to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX/TSX, Vue, Svelte, server templates, UI components, documentation, and backend changes supporting web features.

## Foundations

| Reference | Core Principle |
|---|---|
| DealTech UI | Concrete UI reference hierarchy (elements, sections, pages); adapting components to product requirements without forcing stack shifts. |
| Impeccable | Eliminating AI frontend anti-patterns (generic fonts, cliché purple gradients, card-in-card nesting, low-contrast text). |
| Vibes-Plug | Phased lifecycle connecting planning, implementation, integration, verification, and documentation. |
| Ponytail | Problem comprehension before coding, reusing existing solutions, prioritizing standard libraries, and avoiding premature work. |
| nyancodeid Commit Guidelines | Structured commit messages with consistent types, optional scopes, concise subjects, and clear descriptions. |
| Humanize Pro | Audience-centered language, strict factual accuracy, eliminating artificial boilerplate, and avoiding em dashes. |
| Zero-Emoji Rules | Plain text, text-based status badges, and inline SVG icons instead of decorative symbols or emojis. |

Unified policy: Apply appropriate structure for the task scale, fulfill all requested requirements, and select the simplest working implementation.

## 1. Understand the Project Before Modifying It

- Read the entire prompt and requirements thoroughly. Identify the concrete outcome that the user should experience.
- Inspect related files, data flows, existing components, installed dependencies, configuration files, and project scripts.
- Preserve the existing stack and conventions whenever they meet project needs. Do not swap frameworks, package managers, or styling tools simply because an external reference uses different technologies.
- For bug fixes, trace callers and affected data paths. Address the underlying root cause if multiple paths exhibit the same issue.
- Make reasonable decisions for minor implementation details. Request clarification only when missing information fundamentally alters core requirements or project scope.
- Do not assume external packages, APIs, skills, or components exist. Verify compatibility against actual project files and installed versions.

## 2. Choose the Simplest Solution That Meets Requirements

Follow this decision ladder before writing new code or introducing dependencies:

1. Confirm that the work is genuinely required by the current request.
2. Search for functions, components, types, or patterns already available in the project.
3. Check whether runtime standard libraries (e.g. `fetch`, `URL`, `crypto`, `Intl`) solve the problem.
4. Leverage native platform, browser, CSS, or database capabilities.
5. Utilize already installed dependencies where appropriate.
6. Write a small, readable implementation for uncovered needs.
7. Introduce new dependencies or abstractions only when the benefits are clear, measurable, and justified.

Concise code must retain input validation, error handling, security, accessibility, and the requested behavior. Avoid dense one-liners that degrade readability and maintainability.

| Requirement | Starting Point | Consider Additional Solutions If |
|---|---|---|
| Simple date picker | Native browser date input (`<input type="date">`) | Complex range selection or specialized calendar UX is required. |
| Collapsible FAQ | Native `<details>` and `<summary>` elements | Product interactions exceed standard element behavior. |
| Currency and number formatting | `Intl.NumberFormat` | Specific custom business formatting rules are missing. |
| Responsive layout | CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries | Dynamic layout computations strictly require JavaScript. |
| Multi-variant buttons | Existing button component | Interaction contracts or accessibility states diverge significantly. |

## 3. Use Concrete UI Components as References

Structure UI components across three distinct layers:

- **Elements**: Standalone atomic components (Button, Input, Badge, Switch).
- **Sections**: Page blocks composing multiple elements (Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, Footer).
- **Pages**: Complete compositions combining sections, elements, and routing.

Steps when adopting reference components:

1. Choose a variant matching the functional and visual context.
2. Read the source code, styling, and interactive behavior.
3. Check required imports, assets, selectors, typography, icons, and dependencies.
4. Extract needed parts and adapt them to the project directory structure.
5. Replace dummy copy, links, branding, and asset paths with project data.
6. Verify integration across existing pages and responsive viewports.

When working with a different tech stack than the reference, adapt the visual structure and behavior to your current stack rather than migrating the project.

## 4. Maintain Visual Hierarchy and Component Consistency

- Establish content hierarchy, primary color palettes, typography scales, spacing tokens, and component radius before expanding page count.
- Use existing design tokens (CSS variables or utility classes). Introduce new tokens only when recurring needs arise.
- Preserve brand identity, color schemes, and user-provided design guidelines.
- Align styling across sections: main container widths, heading scales, action buttons, and vertical spacing.
- Ensure layouts remain resilient when text expands, datasets are empty, or screen widths shrink.
- Use subtle animations to clarify transitions or interaction feedback. Respect user motion preferences (`prefers-reduced-motion`).
- Design props and component variants around actual usage. Avoid exhaustive speculative configurations.

## 5. Ensure Complete Behavior and Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements: `<button>` for actions, `<a>` for navigation, and form labels linked to input fields.
- Provide clear visible focus indicators and ensure all interactions are keyboard accessible.
- Provide accessible names on icon buttons via `aria-label`. Distinguish informative images from decorative ones using accurate `alt` attributes.
- Communicate status changes through descriptive text in addition to color cues.
- Implement comprehensive UI states: loading, empty, error, and success.
- Display validation errors in relevant positions and preserve user input when form submissions fail.
- For modal dialogs, trap focus appropriately, support Escape key closing, and restore focus to the trigger element on close.
- Clearly separate mock data from live production endpoints. Never present storage operations as successful before receiving actual confirmation.

## 6. Adapt Workflow to Task Scale

| Task Scale | Workflow | Minimum Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| Local copy / styling fix | Read context, modify files, verify results | Concise commit description |
| Single feature or component | Define behavior, implement, integrate, verify | Props or data contract summary |
| Fullstack feature | Align data schema, API endpoints, UI state, and errors | Interface contracts and verification steps |
| New multi-feature app | PRD, foundation, data architecture, API, UI, testing, hardening, release | Setup guide and operational instructions |

### Eight-Phase Workflow for New Applications

1. **Requirements & PRD**: Define target users, core features, technical constraints, and stack selection.
2. **Project Foundation**: Configure folder structure, linters, formatters, and build scripts.
3. **Data Architecture**: Design database schemas, entity relations, migrations, and security rules.
4. **Services & APIs**: Build backend services, endpoint contracts, input validation, and authentication/authorization.
5. **Frontend & UI**: Implement visual components, navigation routing, state management, and API integration.
6. **Testing**: Validate critical user flows, edge cases, and automated test suites.
7. **Hardening**: Audit security vulnerabilities, optimize asset loading, verify SEO readiness, and ensure graceful error handling.
8. **Release & Handover**: Verify production builds, document deployment steps, and finalize documentation.

## 7. Code Quality and Cleanliness

- Complete primary feature paths; do not leave functional placeholders in production code.
- Avoid duplicate logic, zero-value wrappers, and premature abstractions for single-use functions.
- Confine changes to necessary scopes. Remove dead code and unused imports after verifying references.
- Write comments to clarify non-obvious technical decisions or constraints, not to repeat readable syntax.
- Enforce type safety and runtime validation on data coming from user inputs, external APIs, or file systems.
- Maintain resilient error handling that prevents data loss. Never suppress technical errors in a way that obscures root causes.

## 8. Zero-Emoji Discipline

Do not include emojis or decorative unicode symbols in:

- Headings, body copy, form labels, placeholders, error alerts, toasts, tooltips, and empty states.
- Attributes such as `alt`, `title`, `aria-label`, `data-*`, and metadata tags.
- Variable names, identifiers, string literals, code comments, and terminal logs.
- README files, CHANGELOG files, commit messages, PR descriptions, and documentation.
- Branch, folder, and file names.

Use these alternatives:

| Visual Need | Recommended Alternative |
|---|---|
| Navigation / Action icons | Inline SVG (`<svg>`) or project icon libraries (e.g. Lucide). |
| Status indicators | Text-based badges ("Active", "Failed", "Pending") with CSS styling. |
| List items | Standard Markdown bullets (`-`) or HTML `<ul>` / `<li>` tags. |
| Information emphasis | Typography hierarchy, bold weight, and color contrast. |
| Progress indicators | Status text ("Loading data...") or CSS animation spinners. |

Exceptions apply only when explicitly requested by the user, when displaying raw user-generated data, or when editing legacy files where emojis are already established and out of scope for cleanup.

## 9. Commit Message Guidelines

Commit messages must follow this structure:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Standard types:

- `feat`: New user-facing feature.
- `fix`: Bug fix.
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `perf`: Performance improvements.
- `style`: Formatting, whitespace, or punctuation changes that do not affect code logic.
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests.
- `docs`: Documentation updates.
- `build`: Changes affecting build systems or external dependencies.
- `ci`: Changes to CI/CD configuration files and scripts.

Formatting rules:

- The subject line must be in imperative mood, lower case, without a trailing period, and under 100 characters.
- Scope is optional and indicates the project module (e.g., `auth`, `ui`, `api`, `config`).
- The body provides context and explains the motivation for the change.
- Use `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer for backward-incompatible modifications.

Example:

```text
feat(ui): add responsive dropdown navigation menu
fix(auth): handle expired token verification gracefully
docs(readme): update installation steps and environment variables
```

## 10. Natural Technical Writing

Apply clear, concise, and factual writing standards to all UI copy, documentation, and technical explanations:

- Lead with the primary information directly; remove introductory pleasantries and formulaic conclusions.
- Use active voice and common, accessible vocabulary.
- Explain technical terminology in context when addressing general users.
- Avoid em dashes (`—`). Use commas, periods, colons, or parentheses instead.
- Eliminate hyperbolic claims, unearned superlatives, and artificial praise.
- Preserve factual accuracy and do not fabricate metrics, names, or quotes.
- Ensure UI messages guide users toward clear actions (e.g., "Enter your email address" instead of "Please proceed with entering your email in this field").

## 11. Pre-Handover Verification

Run through this checklist before submitting work:

- [ ] All requirements and feature behaviors are satisfied.
- [ ] Components, imports, asset paths, and dependencies are verified.
- [ ] Layouts are verified across mobile and desktop viewport sizes.
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are implemented.
- [ ] Keyboard navigation and accessibility labels function as intended.
- [ ] Code contains no dead logic or incomplete feature placeholders.
- [ ] Zero-emoji rules are respected across all code, attributes, and text.
- [ ] Commit messages conform to type, scope, and character length standards.
- [ ] Documentation and UI copy are written in natural, concise language.

PowerShell emoji verification command:

```powershell
Select-String -Path .\path\to\file -Pattern '[\p{Cs}\u2190-\u27BF\u2B00-\u2BFF\uFE0F]'
```

## 12. Concrete Delivery

Present completed files with a concise summary of changes, usage instructions, and actual verification results. Never claim testing, skill execution, or deployment actions that have not been performed.
